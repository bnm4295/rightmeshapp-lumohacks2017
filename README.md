# rightmeshapp-lumohacks2017

This is the client application to the master application which takes an encoded string and 
creates a questionnaire to be answered. With the results being submitted back to the master application. Some todo
operations include saving the data to a database, not only displaying questionnaires but also helpful resources.

There is also a zip file of the master application.

This is work done for Lumohacks 2017 a 24h hackathon. Also our first time with android development. A lot of the code is modified from
the Rightmesh HelloMesh app.
